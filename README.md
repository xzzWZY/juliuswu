## Summary

Hi, I'm Julius(Zhiyu) Wu, a dual degree student majoring in Computer Engineering in Umich, Ann Arbor and ECE in SJTU. I'm passonated on developing efficient machine learning system, with both focus on good QoE and energy-efficiency. I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/), and be part of [SymbioticLab](https://symbioticlab.org/). I'm also an active member of [Michigan Quadball](https://michquadball.square.site/).

## Selected Project
### Token Streaming
LLM generates text token by token, and we define it as "token streaming". Inspired by Quality of Experience (QoE) in network, we define QoE in "token streaming", and apply QoE-aware scheduling algorithm in LLM inference. [view project](https://github.com/AmberLJC/TSaaS-vllm)

        <h3>ML.ENERGY Leaderboard</h3>
        <p>The goal of the <a href="https://github.com/ml-energy/leaderboard">ML.ENERGY Leaderboard</a> is to give people a sense of how much energy LLMs would consume. Try our <a href="https://ml.energy/leaderboard/?__theme=light">Colosseum</a> (online LLM serving) to check the energy consumption of LLM inference.</p>

### Key-Oracle
[Key-Oracle](https://github.com/xzzWZY/key-oracle) is a hardware-based elimination of keystroke timing attack and acoustic attack. The embedded device is connected between keyboard and computer so that a random delay is applied between keystroke and computer receiving USB signals. Additionally, pre-recorded sound is played randomly during the keystroke to prevent acoustic attack.
