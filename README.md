## Summary

Hi, I'm Julius Wu, a dual degree student majoring in Computer Engineering in Umich, Ann Arbor and ECE in SJTU. I'm passonated on developing efficient machine learning system, with both focus on good QoS/QoE and energy-efficiency. I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/), and be part of [SymbioticLab](https://symbioticlab.org/). I'm also an active member of [Michigan Quadball](https://michquadball.square.site/).

## Selected Project
### Token Streaming
We state that the LLM inference is a streaming process, and define QoE for LLM inference. System solution is still in progress.

        <h3>ML.ENERGY Leaderboard</h3>
        <p>The goal of the <a href="https://github.com/ml-energy/leaderboard">ML.ENERGY Leaderboard</a> is to give people a sense of how much energy LLMs would consume. Try our <a href="https://ml.energy/leaderboard/?__theme=light">Colosseum</a> (online LLM serving) to check the energy consumption of LLM inference.</p>

### Key-Oracle
[Key-Oracle](https://github.com/xzzWZY/key-oracle) is a hardware-based elimination of keystroke timing attack and acoustic attack. The embedded device is connected between keyboard and computer so that a random delay is applied between keystroke and computer receiving USB signals. Additionally, pre-recorded sound is played randomly during the keystroke to prevent acoustic attack.
